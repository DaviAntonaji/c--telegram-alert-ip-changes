### C# IP Monitoring with Telegram Integration
-------

##### The program initially asks for the credentials of a bot on telegram with Token (must be requested in BotFather) and chat id (which must be captured with idbot).

#####  After the configuration, the first IP sending will be received. Every time the IP is changed the bot will alert that there has been an IP change
